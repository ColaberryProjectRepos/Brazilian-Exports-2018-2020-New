The dataset that I chose for my project required quite a bit of modification. Because it contained 10 years’ worth of data and 13 million rows, I determined I needed to clean it, modify it, and clip it before introducing it into Power BI. I initially used SSIS to do this. I had to read up on database collation and alter it because the values in this data used UTF-8 encoding. I created a data flow and it ran successfully but unfortunately despite several attempts the text in one of my columns kept getting truncated at 100 characters no matter what I did, so I decided to load the data into SQL Server using a different method.&nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">I had issues using BULK INSERT because of permissions issues. This took me several hours to research and fix.&nbsp;</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;">I wanted to add more detail to my dataset and the report I’d build from it. So, I matched sectors, industry groups, and industries to the products in my dataset. I first loaded data from the GICS (global industry classification standard) Wikipedia page to power query in Power BI and cleaned it so that it was in a nice tabular format. I copied and pasted the values into Excel and matched the values I mentioned earlier to my dataset’s product description values one by one. I then created a Product Dimension in SQL Server and inserted the records, I’d matched in Excel, into the Product dimension. This took me a while to get done because I wanted to find an easier way of matching the records but nevertheless, I had to manually match them.</li></ol><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><br></p><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1269/21/2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
