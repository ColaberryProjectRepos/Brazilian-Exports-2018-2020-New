Paulo’s Industrials sector products go to the US. As shown by Covid, dependence
on a select few markets can lead to issues if those markets are negatively
affected. I recommend diversification of target markets to decrease dependence
on the US market for Industrial products.<o:p></o:p></font></p></li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><font color="#283c46">As shown in the data, prior to 2020 the Industrials sector’s

Covid then amplified that decrease/trend. Factors that may allow the Industrials
sector to raise its export earnings include practices such as competitive
pricing, improvements in product quality, and volume discounts. Other
industries may require different recommendations.<o:p></o:p></font></p></li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><p class="MsoNormal" style=""><font color="#283c46">As can be seen in the data, over the three-year period from
2018 to 2020, Brazil has had a decrease of </font><font color="#ce0000"><b>4.4%</b></font><font color="#283c46"> in export earnings every year.
This applies to all states, sectors, industries, and more. The current downturn
might be largely influenced by global economic conditions or by more particular
issues. The Industrials Sector’s downturn has had the largest effect on the
country due to its high decrease in export earnings which is reflected by its decreasing
share of Export Concentration. Analysis of the current global economic
conditions to determine trading partners’ and rivals' economic conditions would
be beneficial. Governmental support can be provided by entering into trade
partnerships and agreements, providing export support, incentives, and
improving trade infrastructure.<o:p></o:p></font></p></li></ol><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><br></p><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1269/22/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
